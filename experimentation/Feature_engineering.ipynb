    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Adobe Customer Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset for Adobe customer segmentation. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that will help us understand how different customer segments interact with Adobe products and services. By doing so, we aim to build a strong foundation for **marketing strategies**, **product recommendations**, and **customer engagement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why EDA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in any data analysis pipeline. It allows us to:\n",
    "- **Understand the data structure**: Identifying the types of data, such as numerical, categorical, or mixed.\n",
    "- **Check for missing values and outliers**: Ensuring the data is clean and that there are no issues that could skew the results.\n",
    "- **Discover patterns and trends**: Visualizing relationships between features and identifying which variables are most relevant to segmentation.\n",
    "- **Form hypotheses**: Gaining insights to generate hypotheses that we can test in later analyses or modeling phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Adobe, the purpose of EDA is to uncover patterns that can guide us in creating **targeted marketing campaigns** based on customer behavior, subscription plans, and product usage. Additionally, EDA will help us understand how features like **usage frequency** and **document types** correlate with customer profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions We Want to Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this EDA, we aim to address the following key questions:\n",
    "1. **Customer Behavior Patterns**:\n",
    "    - How do different customer segments engage with various Adobe products (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects)?\n",
    "    - What is the usage distribution across weekdays, weekends, and across different usage types (e.g., mobile vs. desktop)?\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Product Usage Trends**:\n",
    "    - What products do customers use the most?\n",
    "    - Are there correlations between product usage and subscription types (e.g., premium vs. standard plans)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Segmentation Insights**:\n",
    "    - Can we identify distinct groups based on customer activity (e.g., heavy users vs. light users)?\n",
    "    - What are the key features that distinguish different customer clusters?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Marketing and Engagement**:\n",
    "    - How can we target users based on their usage patterns, document categories, and engagement (e.g., weekend vs. weekday)?\n",
    "    - What features correlate with high customer satisfaction or retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these objectives, we will proceed with the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Overview**:\n",
    "    - Check the structure of the dataset.\n",
    "    - Inspect basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing Values and Duplicates**:\n",
    "    - Check for missing data and decide on the strategy (e.g., imputation or removal).\n",
    "    - Remove any duplicate records to ensure clean analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Univariate Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Analyze individual features (e.g., subscription type, usage on weekdays, or mobile vs. desktop usage).\n",
    "    - Visualize distributions of numerical features and counts of categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Investigate relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., product usage vs. subscription type).\n",
    "    - Create scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Correlation**:\n",
    "    - Examine how features are correlated with each other (e.g., the relationship between different usage types).\n",
    "    - Identify any potential multicollinearity that may impact clustering or segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Customer Segmentation Insights**:\n",
    "    - Investigate if distinct clusters or segments emerge from the data (e.g., heavy product users vs. occasional users).\n",
    "    - Visualize clusters to better understand different customer groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for EDA Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Key Customer Segments**:\n",
    "    - Understanding customer segmentation through features like **subscription type**, **usage patterns**, and **product preferences** helps Adobe tailor marketing campaigns effectively. We can identify the needs and behaviors of high-value customers and build more targeted strategies.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:\n",
    "    - The integrity of the data is vital for accurate modeling. EDA allows us to **identify missing values**, **outliers**, and **incorrect data entries**. Cleaning and preprocessing data before modeling is essential for ensuring reliable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insight Generation**:\n",
    "    - EDA is a valuable step to generate insights that can guide our clustering and segmentation efforts. By looking at patterns in customer usage data, we can better understand which factors are most influential in customer behavior and purchasing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Informing Future Steps**:\n",
    "    - By conducting EDA, we build a solid understanding of the data, which will inform future analysis steps such as **predictive modeling**, **customer segmentation**, and **marketing strategies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA will be a crucial first step toward understanding customer behavior and finding meaningful insights that can drive the next phase of analysis. The goal is to ensure that the **data is clean**, the **right features** are identified, and any **patterns or trends** are uncovered to help Adobe build a more effective marketing and engagement strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin with the first step of the EDA process: inspecting the data and understanding its structure!\n"

    "- **Feature**: `generic_email`\n",
    "- **Justification**: The **email type** can provide hints on whether the user is from a **professional or educational domain** (e.g., `.edu` or `.org`) or a **general user** (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo). Users with domain-specific emails might have different product needs or engagement levels.\n",
    "- **Assumption**: Users with **professional or educational emails** might be more likely to engage with **enterprise-level products** or **business-focused features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Mobile vs Web/Desktop Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features**: `mobile_usage`, `web_usage`\n",
    "- **Justification**: Users' device preferences—whether they use Adobe tools on **mobile**, **desktop**, or via **web applications**—can reveal their engagement level and needs. Desktop users are more likely to perform **resource-heavy tasks**, while mobile users might prefer quick, on-the-go functionality.\n",
    "- **Assumption**: **Mobile users** may need **simplified tools** with a focus on convenience, while **desktop users** are likely more **intensive and advanced** in their usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Camera Used (if Available)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features**: `count_camera_make`, `count_camera_model`\n",
    "- **Justification**: The camera make and model provide insights into the **type of content** users work with, especially for **photographers** and **videographers**. **Professional-grade cameras** (e.g., DSLR or mirrorless) may indicate a need for **advanced editing tools** such as **RAW file processing**.\n",
    "- **Assumption**: **High-end cameras** suggest a **professional user** who might engage in **advanced photo and video editing**, potentially indicating a need for **specialized Adobe tools**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Photoshop Document Categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features**: `ps_doc_category_*` (e.g., watercolor, photo, typography)\n",
    "- **Justification**: These features show the **type of documents** users work on, ranging from **artistic styles** (e.g., watercolor, vector art) to more **professional use cases** (e.g., banners, 3D models). Knowing this helps tailor **feature development** and **marketing strategies** to specific content creation needs.\n",
    "- **Assumption**: Users working on **specific document categories** may require **specialized tools**. For example, **3D designers** need more **3D features** and **high-end rendering tools**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Machine Information**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features**: `machine_ps_max_memory`, `machine_ps_max_speed`, `machine_ps_max_numprocessors`, `operating_system`\n",
    "- **Justification**: The hardware specifications, such as **memory** and **processors**, help understand whether the user is a **professional** with a **high-performance machine** or a **casual user** with less powerful equipment. This distinction can help in determining whether the user needs **advanced or lightweight tools**.\n",
    "- **Assumption**: Users with **high-performance machines** likely need **powerful tools** to match their hardware capabilities. This might indicate **enterprise users** or **creative professionals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. Adobe Products Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features**: `most_used_products`, `num_used_products`, `tb_activity_on_*` (various Adobe tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro)\n",
    "- **Justification**: Understanding which Adobe products users engage with most often and how frequently they use them provides deep insights into their **workflows**. This is useful for identifying potential **cross-selling** opportunities (e.g., selling **Illustrator** to heavy **Photoshop** users).\n",
    "- **Assumption**: Users who engage with multiple Adobe products are more likely to be **professional creatives** who need **bundled solutions** or **premium features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected features cover a wide spectrum of user behavior and preferences, providing key insights into both **user intent** and **usage patterns**. By analyzing these features, we can effectively segment users and make **data-driven marketing decisions**, **product recommendations**, and **feature enhancements** based on user needs. This holistic view allows for **more personalized and effective strategies** for engaging Adobe’s diverse customer base.\n"

    "# Data Preprocessing Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why We're Removing Specific Columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are working with a rich dataset containing various features related to Adobe product usage and user activities. However, certain features require special handling due to their high volume of missing or placeholder values, which can potentially skew our analysis and introduce noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have decided to remove the following columns for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **sv_job_collated, sv_skill_collated, sv_purpose_collated:**\n",
    "These columns contain a high proportion of placeholder values (\"-1\"), indicating a lack of response or unavailable data. Since these placeholders represent non-responses rather than actual values, they would likely introduce bias if left in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **sv_job_collated**: The job role of the user, with categories like \"hobbyist\" and \"photographer,\" but also with a large number of missing or placeholder values.\n",
    "- **sv_skill_collated**: User skill levels, including categories like \"beginner,\" \"intermediate,\" and \"experienced,\" but again, a high number of \"-1\" values, which likely represent missing data.\n",
    "- **sv_purpose_collated**: The purpose behind using the Adobe products (professional, non-professional, or organizational use), but with a complex structure that includes placeholders and many possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that these columns have many missing or irrelevant values, keeping them could add unnecessary complexity. Instead, we believe it's more beneficial to focus on other features like actual usage metrics (e.g., `tb_activity_on_photoshop`, `tb_tot_no_activities`) to infer skills or purposes based on behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Activity-based Skill Inference:**\n",
    "Rather than relying on the potentially inaccurate or incomplete data in `sv_skill_collated` or `sv_purpose_collated`, we can infer user behavior and skills from actual product usage data (e.g., time spent on each product, number of activities performed). This will allow us to create more robust skill and purpose classifications based on real actions taken by users, rather than relying on incomplete survey data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Separation for Backup:**\n",
    "We will store the removed columns in a separate DataFrame (`df_removed`) as a backup. This allows us to keep these columns for potential future analysis or imputation strategies if needed, without losing any data. This separation also provides us the flexibility to revisit these features after we test and refine our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Removing these columns will reduce noise and simplify the dataset. The focus will shift towards more reliable features that represent actual user behavior, allowing us to create more meaningful user segments and better understand the value drivers for different customer segments. We may revisit these features later if we choose to experiment with imputation or other methods for handling missing data.\n"

    "\n",
    "To simplify the analysis and improve the interpretability of the data, we group categories that represent less than 10% of the total into an \"Other\" category. This helps in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus on Major Categories**: By consolidating smaller categories, we prioritize the most significant data.\n",

    "1. **Conversion to Numeric**: We converted the `machine_ps_max_memory` values to numeric data types to ensure consistency and facilitate downstream analysis. Non-numeric values, such as invalid strings, are coerced to `NaN`.\n",

    "3. **Removing Rows with NaN Values**: After replacing invalid values, rows containing `NaN` were dropped, ensuring that only valid memory values remain for categorization.\n",

    "   - **Low**: Memory size ≤ 8 GB\n",

    "### Justification for Handling and Binning `machine_ps_max_speed` Feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Conversion to Numeric**:\n",
    "   - **Why**: The original values of `machine_ps_max_speed` may include non-numeric entries or placeholders such as 'NoValue' or '0'. Converting the column to numeric ensures that we work with valid numerical data for analysis or model building. \n",
    "   - **How**: Using `pd.to_numeric()`, we handle potential errors by coercing invalid values to `NaN` which can then be filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Removing Invalid or Irrelevant Values**:\n",
    "   - **Why**: Entries such as 'NoValue' and 0 are not meaningful for machine performance analysis. These need to be excluded to avoid distorting our understanding of machine capabilities.\n",
    "   - **How**: We filter out rows containing these invalid values using the `notna()` and condition checks, ensuring the dataset reflects actual, relevant machine performance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Binning the Speed Values**:\n",
    "   - **Why**: Raw continuous data, like machine speeds, can be difficult to interpret or analyze in its raw form. By grouping the speeds into bins (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Very High), we simplify the data into meaningful categories that can be more easily related to user activity or machine performance.\n",
    "   - **How**: We define speed categories using specific numeric ranges, which can be adjusted based on the distribution of values or domain knowledge. This process reduces noise and makes it easier to analyze correlations with other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Dropping the Original Column**:\n",
    "   - **Why**: After binning, the original `machine_ps_max_speed` column is redundant and could lead to confusion in the analysis or modeling process. Removing it ensures the dataset is clean and that we're only working with the new categorical feature, which provides the necessary context.\n",
    "   - **How**: We use `df.drop()` to remove the original column from the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Benefit:\n",
    "   - **Improved Interpretability**: By transforming raw numeric values into categories, it enhances the understanding of machine capabilities and their correlation with other features.\n",
    "   - **Model Performance**: Some machine learning algorithms perform better with categorical features rather than continuous ones, especially when the data contains outliers or a wide range of values.\n",
    "   - **Consistency**: This approach provides consistent, categorized data, making it easier to analyze patterns in user behavior, machine usage, and product interaction.\n",

    "#### Justification for `most_used_products`:\n",
    "The `most_used_products` feature represents the products most frequently used by the users. We first calculate the proportion of each product in the dataset to understand its distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We set a threshold of 1% for categorizing products as \"Other\" to group less frequent products together. Any product with a proportion lower than 1% is renamed as \"Other\". This approach helps simplify the feature and reduces the number of rare categories that might otherwise not provide meaningful insights during analysis or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By consolidating rare products into \"Other\", we ensure that the model focuses on the most significant product usage patterns while minimizing noise from low-frequency categories.\n"
