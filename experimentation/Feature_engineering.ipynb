    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Adobe Customer Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset for Adobe customer segmentation. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that will help us understand how different customer segments interact with Adobe products and services. By doing so, we aim to build a strong foundation for **marketing strategies**, **product recommendations**, and **customer engagement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why EDA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in any data analysis pipeline. It allows us to:\n",
    "- **Understand the data structure**: Identifying the types of data, such as numerical, categorical, or mixed.\n",
    "- **Check for missing values and outliers**: Ensuring the data is clean and that there are no issues that could skew the results.\n",
    "- **Discover patterns and trends**: Visualizing relationships between features and identifying which variables are most relevant to segmentation.\n",
    "- **Form hypotheses**: Gaining insights to generate hypotheses that we can test in later analyses or modeling phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Adobe, the purpose of EDA is to uncover patterns that can guide us in creating **targeted marketing campaigns** based on customer behavior, subscription plans, and product usage. Additionally, EDA will help us understand how features like **usage frequency** and **document types** correlate with customer profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions We Want to Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this EDA, we aim to address the following key questions:\n",
    "1. **Customer Behavior Patterns**:\n",
    "    - How do different customer segments engage with various Adobe products (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects)?\n",
    "    - What is the usage distribution across weekdays, weekends, and across different usage types (e.g., mobile vs. desktop)?\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Product Usage Trends**:\n",
    "    - What products do customers use the most?\n",
    "    - Are there correlations between product usage and subscription types (e.g., premium vs. standard plans)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Segmentation Insights**:\n",
    "    - Can we identify distinct groups based on customer activity (e.g., heavy users vs. light users)?\n",
    "    - What are the key features that distinguish different customer clusters?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Marketing and Engagement**:\n",
    "    - How can we target users based on their usage patterns, document categories, and engagement (e.g., weekend vs. weekday)?\n",
    "    - What features correlate with high customer satisfaction or retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these objectives, we will proceed with the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Overview**:\n",
    "    - Check the structure of the dataset.\n",
    "    - Inspect basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing Values and Duplicates**:\n",
    "    - Check for missing data and decide on the strategy (e.g., imputation or removal).\n",
    "    - Remove any duplicate records to ensure clean analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Univariate Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Analyze individual features (e.g., subscription type, usage on weekdays, or mobile vs. desktop usage).\n",
    "    - Visualize distributions of numerical features and counts of categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Investigate relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., product usage vs. subscription type).\n",
    "    - Create scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Correlation**:\n",
    "    - Examine how features are correlated with each other (e.g., the relationship between different usage types).\n",
    "    - Identify any potential multicollinearity that may impact clustering or segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Customer Segmentation Insights**:\n",
    "    - Investigate if distinct clusters or segments emerge from the data (e.g., heavy product users vs. occasional users).\n",
    "    - Visualize clusters to better understand different customer groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for EDA Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Key Customer Segments**:\n",
    "    - Understanding customer segmentation through features like **subscription type**, **usage patterns**, and **product preferences** helps Adobe tailor marketing campaigns effectively. We can identify the needs and behaviors of high-value customers and build more targeted strategies.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:\n",
    "    - The integrity of the data is vital for accurate modeling. EDA allows us to **identify missing values**, **outliers**, and **incorrect data entries**. Cleaning and preprocessing data before modeling is essential for ensuring reliable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insight Generation**:\n",
    "    - EDA is a valuable step to generate insights that can guide our clustering and segmentation efforts. By looking at patterns in customer usage data, we can better understand which factors are most influential in customer behavior and purchasing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Informing Future Steps**:\n",
    "    - By conducting EDA, we build a solid understanding of the data, which will inform future analysis steps such as **predictive modeling**, **customer segmentation**, and **marketing strategies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA will be a crucial first step toward understanding customer behavior and finding meaningful insights that can drive the next phase of analysis. The goal is to ensure that the **data is clean**, the **right features** are identified, and any **patterns or trends** are uncovered to help Adobe build a more effective marketing and engagement strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s begin with the first step of the EDA process: inspecting the data and understanding its structure!\n"
